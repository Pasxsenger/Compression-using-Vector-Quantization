Hi!

The commands to run the program as below:

javac MyCompression.java
java MyCompression [imagename] [M] [N]




For example 1:

javac MyCompression.java
java MyCompression image1-onechannel.rgb 2 8


For example 2:

javac MyCompression.java
java MyCompression image1-onechannel.rgb 4 16


Also, for the robustness test, you can input illegal M and N.


Thank you!
